## üìù Work Flow
This research focuses on the following objectives: 

i.	Detection and quantification of fruits using deep learning methods. 

ii.	Checking the ripeness of fruit and classifying ripened, semi-ripened and green tomatoes using colour thresholding and cascaded classifier methods (using HOG features or other method) .

iii.Detection of fruit with defects (using the Colour Segmentation Method or other methods).

### A. Dataset
#### 1. Raw Data
[The Laboro Tomato](https://github.com/laboroai/LaboroTomato) dataset comprises images capturing tomatoes in various stages of ripening, tailored for tasks involving object detection and instance segmentation. Additionally, the dataset offers two distinct subsets categorized by tomato size. These images were acquired at a local farm, utilizing two separate cameras, each contributing to varying resolutions and image quality.
